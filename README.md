Slay the multi-repository monster and manage multiple repositories with a simple interface.

Managing multiple repositories is hard. Trying to stay up-to-date on all your machines is even harder. You may have tried putting your repository in your Dropbox, a different cloud provider or using BitTorrent Sync. You might have a put code in a virtual machine and then sync'ed your virtual machine across multiple machines. (I did all those things!)
But there are some shortcomings with all of those and chances are your repository is already centralized on Github, Bitbucket or on your own hosted platform, so we only need sync our repositories with that centralized repository.
